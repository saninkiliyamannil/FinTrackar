# UI Primitives

Reusable Tailwind UI primitives for page refactors:

- `Button`
- `Input`
- `Textarea`
- `Select`
- `Card`
- `Badge`

Import from:

```ts
import { Button, Card, Input, Select, Textarea, Badge } from "@/components/ui";
```

These are intentionally simple wrappers to keep styling consistent while we split large pages into smaller feature pages.
